	 * transient descendant over the whole prompt, so projection swaps each embedded
	 * capture for its portable parts and carries everything around them through

	 * prevent. The descendant is not retained — its key is not ours to own.
	 *
	 * A prompt pi rebuilt for an agent we already captured — a tool registered after
	 * the turn began, an MCP server that finished connecting — is neither, because the
	 * rebuild edits pi's own sections while every portable part stays byte-identical.
	 * Those turns are re-keyed onto the capture whose portable text they still carry,
	 * which matters most for turns an extension injects (a fired background monitor,
	 * say): they never fire `before_agent_start`, so nothing re-records them and the
	 * first one after any rebuild would otherwise fail for the rest of the session.

	 * empty capture instead would hand Claude Code a turn with none of the user's
	 * context files, skills, custom prompt or append text, and say so only in a debug
	 * line — silently discarding policy the user wrote down. A failed turn is
